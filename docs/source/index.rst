Welcome to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Remake's documentation!
==========================================================

**Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Remake**  is a Python app created using the PyGame
module which recreates the Nintendo DS game *Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers
of Sky*.

The assets used in this project are by the original creators of the Pokemon 
Mystery Dungeon series, as well as the people working on the `Skytemple 
<https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple>`_ project.

This fan-made project is intended for personal educational purposes only.
